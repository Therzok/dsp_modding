# OrderSaves

A [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/) mod which fixes a quality of life issue with the save/load window, by sorting the saves based on the last write, putting the newest at the top.

There is currently no configuration to the sort order.

##  Installing

:hammer_and_wrench: Just install via [Thunderstore](https://dsp.thunderstore.io), it will automatically download everything needed.

To manually install, ensure [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is installed first and then drop the `OrderSaves.dll` file into `$DSP_GAME\BepInEx\Plugins\OrderSaves\OrderSaves.dll`.

For any :bug: or issues with this mod, please report them over at [GitHub](https://github.com/Therzok/dsp_modding/issues/new).
